# Buttons

A button component in the dash-ui library is a user interface element that allows the user to interact with the application by clicking or tapping on it. It typically consists of a text label and/or an icon, and can be configured with various properties such as color, size, and behavior. The button component can also be used in conjunction with other dash-ui components to create more complex user interfaces.
